# My Portfolio Website

Personal portfolio website built with **React + Vite**.  
This project showcases my work, skills, and learning journey as a Frontend Developer.

## 🚀 About This Project

This portfolio is **my first personal web project** that I built seriously as part of my journey into web development.

The purpose of this project is to:

- Practice building real-world applications using React
- Apply clean component structure and reusable patterns
- Serve as a personal portfolio that represents my growth

This project **will continue to be updated over time** as:

- I build new projects
- I improve my technical and design skills
- I learn new tools, frameworks, and best practices

This repository reflects **progress and learning**, not a finished end product.
